    "## Introducing scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling data is crucial when preparing it for machine learning models, especially for those that involve regularisation. Regularisation techniques, such as L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularisation, adjust model complexity by applying penalties to the coefficients of predictors. The magnitude of these penalties is influenced by the scale of the predictors, making scaling an essential step to ensure fairness and effectiveness in regularisation. Essentially, if the features are on different scales, the model might unfairly penalise smaller-scale features more than those on a larger scale. Therefore, to apply regularisation uniformly across all features, we must standardise their scales.\n",

    "### Normalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is with $[0,1]$-normalisation, otherwise known as min-max normalisation: squeezing your data into the range $[0,1]$. Through normalisation, the maximum value of a variable becomes one, the minimum becomes zero, and the values in between become decimals between zero and one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement this transformation by applying the following operation to each of the values of a predictor variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{x}_{ij} = \\frac{x_{ij}-min(x_j)}{max(x_j)-min(x_j)},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{x}_{ij}$ is the value after normalisation, $x_{ij}$ is the $i^{th}$ item of $x_j$, and $min()$, $max()$ return the smallest and largest values of variable $x_j$ respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normalisation is useful because it ensures all variables share the same range: $[0,1]$. One problem with normalisation, however, is that if there are outliers, the bulk of your data will all lie in a small range, so you will lose information."

    "### Standardisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-score standardisation, or simply standardisation, on the other hand, does not suffer from this drawback as it handles outliers gracefully. \n",
    "\n",
    "We implement Z-score standardisation by applying the following operation to each of our variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{x}_{ij} = \\frac{x_{ij} - \\mu_j}{\\sigma_j}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\mu_j$ represents the mean of variable $x_j$, while $\\sigma_j$ is the variable's standard deviation. As can be seen from the above formula, instead of dividing by the full range of our variable, we instead divide by a more distribution-aware measure in the standard deviation. While this doesn't completely remove the effects of outliers, it does consider them in a more conservative manner. As a trade-off to using this transformation, our variable is no longer contained within the $[0,1]$ range as it was during normalisation (in fact, it can now take on a range which includes negative values). This means that all our variables won't be bound to the exact same range (i.e. they can have slightly different influence levels on the learned regression coefficients during regularisation), but they are far closer to one another than they were before the use of standardisation."
